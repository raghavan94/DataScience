<name>Cole</name> faces lengthy injury lay-off

Aston Villa's <name>Carlton Cole</name> could be out for six weeks with a knee injury.

The striker, who is on a season-long loan from Chelsea, picked up the knock in an England Under-21 match against Holland earlier this month. "<name>Carlton</name> will be out of action for four to six weeks after a bad challenge," said Villa boss <name>David O'Leary</name>. "I won't be able to tell you whether he will need an operation until maybe next week. Whether he has an operation has got to be left to Chelsea." <name>Cole</name>, who also struggled with an ankle problem earlier in the season, was unable to rest because <name>O'Leary</name> had a shortage of strikers. The return to fitness of <name>Darius Vassell</name> after four months out with a broken ankle and the emergence of <name>Luke Moore</name> has alleviated some of the Villa's manager's problems in that department.
