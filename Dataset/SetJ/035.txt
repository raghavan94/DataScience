Injury doubts beset Wales squad

Wales have a clutch of injury worries before Wednesday's international friendly against Hungary in Cardiff.

West Ham's <name>Gavin Williams</name> (ankle) looks certain to be out, so uncapped Wrexham defender <name>Stephen Roberts</name> is drafted in. Defenders <name>Danny Gabbidon</name> and <name>Gareth Roberts</name>, plus <name>Ryan Giggs</name> have hamstring concerns, while there are also doubts over <name>Robbie Savage</name> (groin). However, Manchester United winger <name>Giggs</name> is expected to recover in time to earn his 50th cap at the Millennium Stadium. There were also doubts over <name>Gabbidon's</name> fellow Cardiff defender <name>Rhys Weston</name>, but the full-back appears to have shrugged off the knock he picked up in the Bluebirds' 1-0 loss to West Ham on Sunday. The news leaves Wales boss <name>John Toshack</name> short in defence for his first game in charge, with Aston Villa's <name>Mark Delaney</name> injured and <name>James Collins</name> with the Under-21s. That could clear the way for new faces <name>Danny Collins</name> and <name>Dave Partridge</name> to make their Wales debuts.
