<name>Weir</name> poised for Sunderland move

Larne's teenage star <name>Robbie Weir</name> is poised to join Sunderland after turning down a move to Stoke City.

The 17-year-old Irish League midfielder was also being chased by Rangers and Fulham, but <name>Mick McCarthy's</name> side appear to have won the race. But Larne boss <name>Jimmy McGeough</name> has yet to confirm that <name>Weir</name> is on his way from Inver Park. "I heard on Sunday that he has joined Sunderland, but not from the lad himself," he said. ''<name>Robbie</name> has an agreement with Larne that he can negotiate with interested clubs.

''Personally, I would rather see him making an impact at local level to build up his physique before moving into the full-time game. ''He has been on trial with a number of clubs. But it would be great to see him making it at Sunderland.''
