<name>Andy Roddick</name> will play <name>Cyril Saulnier</name> in the final of the SAP Open in San Jose on Sunday.

The American top seed and defending champion overcame Germany's <name>Tommy Haas</name>, the third seed, 7-6 (7-3) 6-3. And <name>Saulnier</name> survived an injury scare in his semi-final with seventh-seeded Austrian <name>Jurgen Melzer</name>. The Frenchman twisted his ankle early in the second set but overcame <name>Melzer</name>, who was left fuming over a series of line calls, 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-3. "I was feeling horrible earlier in the week," <name>Roddick</name> said. "I thought tonight was another step in the right direction. "On my returns, I was standing in more and I'm getting a little more depth, even if I don't hit a perfect return."

<name>Roddick</name> won the last four points of the first-set tie-break before being broken at the start of the second set. But he broke straight back and then broke <name>Haas</name> again to lead 4-2. "It's extremely frustrating when you have chances against a top-five player and don't do anything with them," admitted <name>Haas</name>. "I rushed a few backhands and he took advantage." <name>Saulnier</name> will move into the world's top 50 for the first time after his passage through to the final. "It's taken a lot of work and a lot of fighting in my mind," he revealed. "Sometimes I didn't believe I could get to a final and now I am here. I've stayed mentally strong. "I'm on the way. I'll keep fighting and work a lot and I'll be up there."
