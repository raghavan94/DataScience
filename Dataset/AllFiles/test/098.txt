<name>Serena</name> ends <name>Sania Mirza's</name> dream

<name>Sania Mirza</name>, the first Indian woman to reach the third round of a Grand Slam tennis event, has lost to women's favourite <name>Serena Williams</name>.

The 18-year-old <name>Mirza</name>, who got a wild card entry into the Australian Open in Melbourne, lost to <name>Williams</name> 1-6,4-6 in the third round. <name>Williams</name> took just 56 minutes to defeat <name>Mirza</name> and sail into the fourth round. The only other Indian woman to win a match at a Grand Slam is <name>Nirupama Vaidyanathan</name>. <name>Vaidyanathan</name> made it to the second round of the Australian Open in 1998.

Playing the biggest match of her life, <name>Mirza</name> made little impact on <name>Williams</name> in the early stages of the game. But the teenager showed more confidence in the second set and engaged the seventh-seeded <name>Williams</name> in some well contested rallies. <name>Mirza</name>, a junior Wimbledon doubles title winner, became the first Indian woman to reach the third round of a grand slam tennis event when she beat Hungarian <name>Petra Mandula</name> on Wednesday. "I'm really excited. I was confident but I didn't think it was going to be that easy," <name>Mirza</name> said after her second round win. "My aim was to win a round here. When I did that I was so relieved, there was no pressure." Tennis is not a particularly popular sport in India, but a number of Indians watched the live telecast of the match between <name>Mirza</name> and <name>Williams</name>. <name>Mirza</name>, who lives in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad known for producing a host of top Indian cricketers, turned professional two years ago. She says she was considered too small when she went for her first tennis classes as a six-year-old girl. "Then finally [the coach] called my parents up and said 'the way she hits the ball, I've never seen a six-year-old hit a ball like that'," <name>Mirza</name> told the Associated Press.
