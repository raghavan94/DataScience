<name>Stam</name> spices up Man Utd encounter

AC Milan defender <name>Jaap Stam</name> says Manchester United "know they made a mistake" by selling him in 2001.

The sides meet at Old Trafford in the Champions League game on Wednesday and the 32-year-old's Dutchman's presence is sure to add spice to the fixture. "United made a mistake in selling me," <name>Stam</name> told Uefa's Champions magazine. "I was settled at Manchester United, but they wanted to sell me. If a club want to sell you, there is nothing you can do. You can be sold like cattle." <name>Sir Alex Ferguson</name> surprised the football world - and <name>Stam</name> - by selling the Dutchman to Lazio for £16.5m in August 2001. The decision came shortly after <name>Stam</name> claimed in his autobiography that <name>Ferguson</name> had tapped him up when he was at PSV Eindhoven. But <name>Ferguson</name> insisted he sold the defender because the transfer fee was too good to refuse for a player past his prime. The affair still rankles with the Dutchman.

"I was settled at Manchester United, I had even just ordered a new kitchen, but they wanted to sell me," he said. "In what other industry can a good employee be ushered out the door against their wishes? "Of course, you can refuse to go, but then the club have the power to put you on the bench. I don't agree that players control the game. "There have been opportunities to confront them in the newspapers, but I have turned them down. What's the point?"

<name>Wednesday's</name> game at Old Trafford will provide an intriguing confrontation between United's young attackers <name>Wayne Rooney</name> and <name>Cristiano Ronaldo</name> and Milan's veteran defence of <name>Stam</name>, <name>Paolo Maldini</name>, <name>Cafu</name> and <name>Alessandro Costacurta</name>. <name>Stam</name> says <name>Rooney's</name> teenage stardom is in stark contract to his own start in the game. "We can't all be <name>Wayne Rooneys</name> - at his age I was training to be an electrician and thought my chance of becoming a professional footballer had gone," he said. "Starting late can be a good thing. Some kids who start early get bored. "I had my youth - having fun, drinking beers, blowing up milk cannisters. It sounds strange but it's a tradition where I grew up in Kampen - and I had done all the things I wanted to do."
