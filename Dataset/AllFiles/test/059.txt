<name>Rush</name> future at Chester uncertain

<name>Ian Rush's</name> future as Chester manager is uncertain after he and assistant <name>Mark Aizlewood</name> refused a severance package.

Chester have won only two of their last 10 League games but Chairman <name>Steve Vaughan</name> claims he cannot afford to sack the 43-year-old Liverpool legend. <name>Vaughan</name> said: "I offered a financial settlement so they could resign with dignity but an obvious action is to dismiss them. "I haven't because of the finances, so technically they're still employees." <name>Vaughan</name> claimed that <name>Aizlewood</name> had "verbally agreed" to the offer. But the Chester chairman added: "After they discussed the offer with their solicitor, who also acts as their agent, they decided to withdraw the verbal agreement, which was disappointing." <name>Rush</name> was appointed at the end of August following the departure of former Liverpool team-mate <name>Mark Wright</name>, who guided Chester to the Conference title last season. Chester were bottom of League Two when <name>Rush</name> took over but the former Liverpool striker enjoyed an impressive start to managerial life, taking the club into the third round of the FA cup and winning the manager-of-the-month award for October. Chester's downturn in form culminated in a 5-0 defeat at Shrewsbury that leaves them hovering just above the League Two relegation zone.
