Injured Chelsea winger <name>Arjen Robben</name> has insisted that he only has a 10% chance of making a return against Barcelona in the Champions League.

And <name>Robben</name> told the Daily Star: "It is not impossible that I will play against Barcelona but it is just a very, very small chance - about 10%."
