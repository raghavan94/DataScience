<name>Cole</name> refuses to blame <name>van Persie</name>

<name>Ashley Cole</name> has refused to blame <name>Robin van Persie</name> for leaving Arsenal with no fully-fit strikers for the FA Cup fifth round replay at Sheffield United.

<name>Van Persie</name> is suspended alongside <name>Dennis Bergkamp</name> and <name>Jose Antonio Reyes</name> after being sent off at Southampton when Arsenal had a numerical advantage. <name>Thierry Henry</name> is ruled out with an Achilles tendon injury but <name>Cole</name> said: "No-one is putting the blame on <name>Robin</name>. "It's just something that happens on the spur of the moment." <name>Cole</name> added: "I've done it before and I hope they didn't blame me for anything. "Of course he'll learn. I've been sent off a couple of times now and it's just one of those things when you go a bit crazy for one or two seconds. <name>Freddie Ljungberg</name> is likely to be used in an emergency striking role and will be partnered by either <name>Arturo Lupoli</name>, <name>Quincy Owusu-Abeyie</name> or <name>Jeremie Aliadiere</name>. Gunners boss <name>Arsene Wenger</name> said: "<name>Freddie</name> is an option but we need a second striker. "I have to decide whether it will be <name>Aliadiere</name>, <name>Quincy</name> or <name>Lupoli</name> who will start with him up front. Those three will be involved." Arsenal are also without winger <name>Robert Pires</name>, who sustained an ankle injury at St Mary's. <name>Wenger</name> added: "It doesn't look like anything is fractured, but it is a good ankle sprain. "It does not look like <name>Pires</name> will be ready for two to three weeks."
